# Enhanced Account Profile Management

## Overview

This feature enhances the account profile management system with improved association capabilities and better session handling. The implementation focuses on performance optimization and user experience improvements.

## Feature Description

### Enhanced Profile Association

**Location**: `pages/api/account/account.js`

The `associateProfileWithAccount` function has been enhanced to:

1. Provide more efficient profile association logic
2. Improve error handling and logging
3. Add better validation for profile relationships
4. Optimize database operations for better performance

### Improved Session Management

**Location**: `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`

The session callback has been enhanced with:

1. Better user data synchronization
2. Improved trial period management
3. Enhanced account type handling
4. More robust session state management

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements

- Faster profile association operations
- More efficient session handling
- Reduced database query overhead
- Better memory utilization

### User Experience Enhancements

- More reliable profile management
- Improved session consistency
- Better error handling
- Enhanced trial period tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Profile Association Enhancements

- Optimized database operations
- Improved error handling
- Better logging and monitoring
- Enhanced validation logic

### Session Management Improvements

- Better user data synchronization
- Improved trial period handling
- Enhanced account state management
- More robust error recovery

## Testing

### Profile Association Testing

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/account/test-profile-association \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "accountId": "ACCOUNT_ID",
    "profileId": "PROFILE_ID", 
    "testIterations": 5
  }'
```

### Manual Testing

1. Create profile associations and verify they work correctly
2. Test session management under various conditions
3. Verify trial period handling works as expected
4. Check error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Files Modified

1. `pages/api/account/account.js` - Enhanced profile association logic
2. `pages/api/account/test-profile-association.js` - Testing endpoint for profile associations
3. `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` - Improved session management

## Expected Behavior

### Profile Associations

- Fast and reliable profile association
- Proper error handling and validation
- Consistent database state
- Good performance under load

### Session Management

- Reliable session state management
- Proper trial period tracking
- Consistent user data synchronization
- Robust error recovery

## Performance Considerations

The implementation focuses on:

- Optimizing database operations
- Reducing memory usage
- Improving response times
- Enhancing scalability
